This project is to create an entire web page

The Odin Project project has provided me with what the website is suppose to look like, along with a style specifications sheet (font, font-size, and colors). The goal of this project will be to implement the design according to specifications.

The purpose of this project is to not only create a web page, but to also style it with a layout utilizing flexbox. By this project's completion, I will have demonstrated appropriate use of flexbox and its capabilities in order to create a web page that matches the prompt's layout design specifications.
